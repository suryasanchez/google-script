# Google Scripts

Here is my personal collection of Google Scripts.

## [Instagram followers :camera:](instagram-followers.gs)

This script aims to collect the number of followers for Instagram accounts inside a Google Spreadsheet. You can add a trigger and run this script automatically.

The script is inspired from these two articles:
[Automatically create Instagram Analytics](https://medium.com/@thomas.strosse/how-to-automatically-create-instagram-analytics-with-a-google-sheets-scripts-325ee5fa8e7e) and [Instagram after April 5th 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-track-instagram-stats-after-april-5th-2018-using-google-bast/)
